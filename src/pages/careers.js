          We are flautists (yes, it is spelled that way!), breakfast (only)
          chefs, giant mug collectors, and competitive Waldo finders who hail
          from the Ivory Coast, Brooklyn, San Francisco, Minneapolis, and
          Montana.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every day we feel lucky to bring these experiences, and perspectives
          that have shaped who we are to the products and programs we build to
          end the crisis of mass incarceration.
