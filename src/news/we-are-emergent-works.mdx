### Why the change?

As an organization, we have evolved over the years. Before, we exclusively focused on teaching and mentoring individuals that have been impacted by the justice system. We have mentored XX fellows and taught about XX workshops in the past XX years. Even though we done some good work, we are consistently focusing on how we can improve our community in New York City and around the country.

### The Now

We have evolved with the times and made adjustments to how we can provide value to the community. We are officially at 501c3 and with that, we will be doing the following:

- Teaching online web development workshops
- Started an agency as a pipeline for our fellows to gain real world experience and as a way for us to be self sufficient.
