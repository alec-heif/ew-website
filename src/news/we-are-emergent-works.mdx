### Why the change?

Since our founding in 2018, we have come a long way. We started as a laptop donation program and have gradually evolved into a learning community for formerly incarcerated and justice-involved folks in the early stages of their coding careers. 

Over these years we have gifted over 85 laptops and we have taught over 50 students, all because of our amazing tribe of volunteers, donors, and supporters.

Now, we take our next step with a new focus: **paid apprenticeships**. Moving forward, we will not only offer our students opportunities to learn to code, but also give them their first software engineering job. With this new mission comes a new name. 

### Emergent Works

Emergent Works is a nonprofit software company that trains and employs formerly incarcerated people.
